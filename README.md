## Warning

There's some bugs related to level up, i recommend to don't use this code until these bugs get fixed.

## About

This code allows your Pokémon to evolve during a battle.

### Build Instructions

You must have `DevkitARM` and `Python 3.7` in your `PATH` variable. `Python 3.8` or higher willn't work!

Run the following command:  `python scripts/make.py`

#### Cloning the repo

Open your terminal to whatever folder you want to download this repo into. Then, do the following to download the repo:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/BluRosie/firegold-code.git
$ cd firegold-code
```

Alternatively, you can download the code as a .zip file from the arrow above.  You can navigate to whichever branch for whichever feature you would like to check out as well.

#### Adding your ROM

Copy your ROM to this directory and rename it `BPRE0.gba`.

#### Configuration

##### Compile Time Constants

Open [scripts/make.py](https://github.com/BluRosie/firegold-code/blob/template/scripts/make.py#L12) in a text editor to set some compile-time configuration.

The build system is smart enough to find enough free space on its own, and if you want it to be inserted at a particular address, you can specify it by updating the definition of `OFFSET_TO_PUT`:

```python
OFFSET_TO_PUT = 0x1C88650
SEARCH_FREE_SPACE = True   # Set to True if you want the script to search for free space
                           # Set to False if you don't want to search for free space as you for example update the engine
```

The build system will use `OFFSET_TO_PUT` to determine where in the ROM it should start looking for free space if `SEARCH_FREE_SPACE` is `True`.  Otherwise, the build system places the code to insert directly at `OFFSET_TO_PUT`.

#### Building the project itself

Once you're ready, run:

```shell
$ python scripts/make.py
```

This won't actually modify `BPRE0.gba`, instead your output will be in `test.gba`. Naturally, test it in an emulator before continuing.

### Credits

This code was ported from [CtrlFootPrint's pokeemerald](https://github.com/CtrlFootPrint/pokeemerald/tree/MidBattleEvo).

Skeli made the [build system used in the CFRU](https://github.com/Skeli789/Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade) which is used here.
